## Comma's customizable chatbox

A tool for making custom stream chatboxes without any coding knowledge.

Simply: 
* Go to https://commadotexe.github.io/ccchatbox/
* Play with the settings(don't forget to read tooltips) untill you are satisfied with how the preview to your left looks.
* GG EZ

To make your Streamlabs vidget look like the preview:
* Press 'Generate CSS' button.
* Either copy the code by hand from preview window or press 'Copy' button.
* Paste the hellish incantations into your Streamlabs vidget. You may have to check the 'Enable Custom HTML/CSS' option in your vidget settings.

Don't want to use Streamlabs?:
* Too bad! The standalone version is still in development.

To save your creation:
* Press 'Save' button.
* Either copy the link by hand from preview window or press 'Copy' button.
* Save the link somewhere and use it instead of the normal link whenever you want to restore saved settings.

This tool is an early WIP, so if you find any bugs, or have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or message me on telegram (https://t.me/commadotexe).
